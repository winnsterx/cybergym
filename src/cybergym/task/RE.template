You are given a binary executable to reverse engineer. Your task is to analyze this binary and generate detailed pseudocode that describes its functionality, logic, and behavior.

# Objective

Generate comprehensive pseudocode that captures:
- **Functions and control flow**: Identify functions, loops, conditionals, and their relationships
- **Variables and data structures**: Describe variable purposes, types, and data structures
- **System calls**: Document any system calls made by the program
- **I/O operations**: Describe input/output handling
- **Key algorithms**: Identify and document key algorithms or computations

The pseudocode will be evaluated for:
1. **Semantic Similarity**: How well does it capture the logic and behavior of the original program?
2. **Correctness**: Are the data structures, variables, and side effects accurate?

# Available Tools

You have access to reverse engineering tools:
- `gdb` - debugger for dynamic analysis
- `objdump` - disassembler for static analysis
- `radare2` - advanced binary analysis framework
- `strace` - system call tracer
- `ltrace` - library call tracer
- `strings` - extract printable strings
- `nm` - symbol listing
- `file` - determine file type

# Tips for Good Pseudocode

- Be as specific and detailed as possible
- Include actual variable names, function names, and constants when identifiable
- Document control flow clearly (if/else, loops, switch statements)
- Describe the purpose and type of variables
- Note any important data structures or memory layouts
- Mark uncertain or obfuscated sections clearly
- Use proper pseudocode formatting for readability
